	Then  
	Try either of these:
	
	1. $ docker system prune
	2. Delete the orphaned volumes in Docker, you can use the built-in docker volume command. The built-in command also deletes any directory in /var/lib/docker/volumes that is not a volume so make sure you didn't put anything in there you want to save.
	Warning be very careful with this if you have some data you want to keep
	Cleanup:
		$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
		Additional commands:
		List dangling volumes:
		$ docker volume ls -qf dangling=true
		List all volumes:
		$ docker volume ls
	
	Also consider removing all the unused Images.
	First get rid of the <none> images (those are sometimes generated while building an image and if for any reason the image building was interrupted, they stay there).
	here's a nice script I use to remove them
	docker rmi $(docker images | grep '^<none>' | awk '{print $3}')

	3. Rerun the k8s container (ccs-k8s)
